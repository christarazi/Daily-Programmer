# DoublePriorityQueue
A Python3 program to implement a double priority queue, in response to [/r/dailyprogrammer challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/2vkwgb/20150211_challenge_201_practical_exercise_get/).

## Time Complexity
Source: https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
* `enqueue`                 - O(1)
* `dequeueA` and `dequeueB` - O(n)
* `dequeueFirst`            - O(1)
* `count`                   - O(1)

## Usage
1. Run `main()` to see the queue in action.
2. Run `test()` to see the time it takes to enqueue and dequeue 100,000 elements.
